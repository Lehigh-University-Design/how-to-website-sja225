  <h1>How to Make a Simple Paper Airplane</h1>
  <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
  <p>A piece of letter-sized paper (8.5 x 11 inches)</p>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>  
  
  <ol>
      <h3>Choose Your Paper:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with a standard piece of letter-sized paper. </li>
    <li>You can use plain white sheets or any other type, as long as it's not too thick or heavy.</li>
  </ul>
      <h3>Fold in Half:</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Fold the paper in half lengthwise (hotdog-style). </li>
    <li>Make sure the edges align neatly. </li>
  </ul>
      <h3>Unfold and Fold the Corners:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Unfold the paper back to its original position</li>
      <li>Now, fold the top corners towards the center crease, creating two triangles at the top.</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Fold the Triangles Inward:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Next,fold the triangles you created inward so their long edges meet along the center crease.</li>
      <li>This forms a narrower triangular shape</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Fold in Half Again:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fold the entire paper half along the center crease so the triangles are on the inside.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fold the Wings Down:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Take the top layer of the paper on both sides and fold them down diagonally, aligning the edges with the bottom edge of the plane.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Shape the Wings:</h3>
    <ul>
      
    </ul>

    
    </ol>
