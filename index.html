  <h2>Instructions:</h2>  
  
  <ol>
    <h3>Choose Your Paper:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a standard piece of letter-sized paper. </li>
        <li>You can use plain white sheets or any other type, as long as it's not too thick or heavy.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Fold in Half:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fold the paper in half lengthwise (hotdog-style). </li>
        <li>Make sure the edges align neatly. </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Unfold and Fold the Corners:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Unfold the paper back to its original position</li>
        <li>Now, fold the top corners towards the center crease, creating two triangles at the top.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Fold the Triangles Inward:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Next, fold the triangles you created inward so their long edges meet along the center crease.</li>
        <li>This forms a narrower triangular shape</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Fold in Half Again:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fold the entire paper half along the center crease so the triangles are on the inside.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Fold the Wings Down:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the top layer of the paper on both sides and fold them down diagonally, aligning the edges with the bottom edge of the plane.</li>
        <li>This forms the wings of the airplane</li>  
      </ul>
    <h3>Shape the Wings:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjust the wings by gently bending them slightly downward.</li>  
        <li>This tweak can affect the flight pattern of the paper airplane.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol> 

<h2>Ready to Fly:</h2>
  <p>Hold the paper airplane at its midpoint (where the wings are folded). Find an open area and gently toss it, aiming slightly upward.</p>

<h3><strong>HAVE FUN!</strong</strong></h3>
